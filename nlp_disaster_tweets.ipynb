    "# NLP With Disaster Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief Description of The Problem and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter(i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).\n",
    "The task is to build a model that can classify tweets as either related to a real disaster or not. This is a common natural language processing (NLP) problem involving text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data, include 7613 rows of tweets for training, 3263 rows of tweets for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "train.csv: Training data with columns:\n",
    "id: Unique identifier for each tweet\n",
    "text: The tweet content\n",
    "location: The location from where the tweet was sent (optional)\n",
    "keyword: A specific keyword from the tweet (optional)\n",
    "target: Binary label indicating if the tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "test.csv: Test data similar to train.csv but without the target column.\n"
